# ComfyUI-OmniXPU

Thin Intel XPU integration for upstream ComfyUI.

The runtime is deliberately split into three layers:

1. `omni_xpu_kernel` supplies native XPU kernels.
2. `comfy_kitchen` owns generic operator APIs, capability checks, dispatch,
   and safe eager fallback.
3. `ComfyUI-OmniXPU` only adapts ComfyUI call sites that do not yet expose a
   Kitchen entry point, plus a small set of opt-in legacy correctness fixes.

No workflow or model-pipeline replacement is required.

This repository is the standalone home of the custom node, extracted from
[intel/llm-scaler](https://github.com/intel/llm-scaler). The node is also
bundled with the `llm-scaler-omni` ComfyUI image.

## Ownership

| Layer | Current responsibility |
|---|---|
| Kitchen XPU backend | INT8/QTensor operations, FP8 QDQ and stochastic rounding, SVDQuant, AdaLN, four RoPE APIs, and ConvRot |
| ComfyUI adapter | Attention routing, LayerNorm/RMSNorm class integration, the remaining FP8 model/factory bridge, and fused Lumina/Z-Image INT8 FFN wiring |
| Memory adapter | Cached whole-LoRA model budgets plus optional DynamicVRAM per-layer XPU staging measurements |
| Legacy fix | Global `F.interpolate` and `torch.median`/`torch.nanmedian` workarounds; disabled by default |

RoPE, generic INT8 linear dispatch, and the old FP8 negative-zero wrapper are
normally not registered by this custom node. The A770/DG2 compatibility
profile is the narrow exception: when Kitchen has no XPU implementation for
`comfy_kitchen::int8_linear`, the adapter registers the Omni implementation.
It skips registration when a Kitchen XPU backend is already present.

## Install

Install as a ComfyUI custom node (no tag needed; update with `git pull`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blackwood416/ComfyUI-OmniXPU ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-OmniXPU
git -C ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-OmniXPU pull   # later updates
```

The node requires:

- an `omni_xpu_kernel` wheel built for the active XPU target and Torch minor
  (prebuilt Windows wheels are published at
  <https://github.com/Blackwood416/omni-xpu-kernel/releases>; for A770 /
  PyTorch 2.13 use `omni_xpu_kernel-0.2.0b1+torch213.dg2-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl`);
- the pinned `comfy_kitchen` XPU integration;
- upstream ComfyUI.

If an Intel XPU is unavailable, initialization is skipped.

The A770 bridge requires the normal `comfy_kitchen` package that ships with
ComfyUI, but does not require a separate `comfy-kitchen-xpu` installation.

## Components and switches

Adapters are enabled by default and always retain the original ComfyUI route
for unsupported inputs:

```bash
OMNIXPU_ENABLE=0            # Disable every custom-node component
OMNIXPU_ATTENTION=0         # Disable the attention adapter
OMNIXPU_NORM=0              # Disable the norm adapter
OMNIXPU_RMS_ROPE=0          # Disable the A770 RMS-RoPE bridge
OMNIXPU_FP8_GEMM=0          # Disable the temporary FP8 model/factory adapter
OMNIXPU_INT8_FFN=0          # Disable fused Lumina/Z-Image INT8 FFN wiring
OMNIXPU_DYNAMIC_VRAM_BOUNDARY_TRIM=0  # Disable Windows XPU model-boundary trim
OMNIXPU_LORA_MEMORY=0       # Disable cached whole-LoRA budgets and staging logs
OMNIXPU_KITCHEN_COMPAT=0    # Disable the A770 missing-backend bridge
OMNIXPU_INT8_DIRECT_CAST=1  # A770 opt-in: keep offloaded TensorWise INT8 on the quantized path
OMNIXPU_INT8_PATCH_CACHE=1  # A770 opt-in: cache patched bf16 weights across sampling steps
```

On Windows XPU, the boundary trim turns an unmet DynamicVRAM minimum-memory
budget into an explicit partial VBAR reclaim before model loading. It preserves
loaded models and is enabled by default; the environment variable above is the
A/B-test escape hatch.

Validated sub-routes can be disabled independently:

```bash
OMNI_ATTN_BACKEND=auto      # auto, cute, esimd, or torch; Windows defaults to torch
OMNIXPU_NONCONTIG_RMSNORM=0
OMNIXPU_H120_RMSNORM=0
OMNIXPU_KREA2_RMSNORM=0
```

For diagnostics, the per-call CUTE output scan can be enabled explicitly. It
is disabled by default because validated CUTE routes accumulate in FP32 and a
full output scan adds a shape-proportional temporary allocation. Explicit
ESIMD FP16 routing retains its overflow scan regardless of this setting.

```bash
OMNIXPU_VALIDATE_ATTENTION_OUTPUT=1
```

The two global workarounds are opt-in:

```bash
OMNIXPU_INTERPOLATE_FIX=1
OMNIXPU_MEDIAN_FIX=1
OMNIXPU_MEDIAN_STRICT_INDICES=1
```

`OMNIXPU_MEDIAN_STRICT_INDICES=1` reproduces the exact tie-break indices. The
median workaround was only verified on BMG with Torch 2.10 and must not be
enabled by default on PTL-H or another Torch version.

`OMNIXPU_INT8_DIRECT_CAST=1` is an A770-only experiment for partially
offloaded INT8 models. ComfyUI's offload cast path can dequantize a
TensorWise INT8 weight to bf16 before a linear, which hides the real GEMM
cost behind page-in/cast work. The adapter moves the raw qdata/scale to XPU
and returns a device-resident `QuantizedTensor`, so `comfy_kitchen`'s INT8
linear path runs without the bf16 materialization. It only applies when the
module has no LoRA/lowvram/weight functions and is off the current device.
For modules with a LoRA `weight_function`, the first cast still computes the
patched bf16 weight, but the result is cached on CPU; later sampling steps
reuse the cached patched bf16 weight instead of recomputing the LoRA every
step. This is separate (`OMNIXPU_INT8_PATCH_CACHE=1`) because early
measurements showed it can regress under VRAM pressure; leave it off unless
you are A/B testing that specific cache.

## Adapter behavior

Attention uses explicit capability guards. `auto` selects CUTE routes for
matching platform, Torch-version, dtype, layout, and operator contracts, and
uses the original PyTorch attention path for every remaining contract. It
never selects ESIMD. `cute` and `esimd` are explicit diagnostic policies;
unsupported contracts still fall back safely.

On Windows, an unset `OMNI_ATTN_BACKEND` defaults to `torch`, leaving ComfyUI's
PyTorch SDPA route unpatched. ESIMD remains available as an explicit diagnostic
or performance opt-in with `OMNI_ATTN_BACKEND=esimd`; it is never selected
automatically.

On BMG with Torch 2.11, the experimental LTX-style BF16 D128 route accepts
dense B2/H32 self-attention and B1/B2/H32 KV1024 cross-attention inputs as
`[B,L,H*D]` tensors or dense BHLD views. The adapter makes the BHLD view
without a layout copy. B2 self-attention uses CUTE from sequence length 768,
and B1/B2 cross-attention uses it from query length 1024 when KV length is
1024. There is no generation-size-derived upper limit: larger lengths are
selected from the public kernel capability instead of an exact traced shape.

The first use logs a warning with the global rollback setting. If the native
operation raises for a contract, that call falls back to PyTorch and the
contract is quarantined for the rest of the process. Set
`OMNI_ATTN_BACKEND=torch` before ComfyUI startup to disable the experimental
route globally.

The norm adapter preserves ComfyUI cast/offload hooks and uses native kernels
only for eligible tensors. PTL-H H120 and non-contiguous split-QKV routes also
require native feature markers, preventing a stale wheel from taking them.

The FP8 adapter is temporary ComfyUI integration around model/factory paths
that are not completely expressed as Kitchen operations. Generic FP8 tensor
quantization and dequantization remain Kitchen-owned.

The fused INT8 FFN adapter wires eligible Lumina/Z-Image `FeedForward` blocks
to Kitchen/native primitives. It does not register `comfy_kitchen::int8_linear`
and does not replace a model pipeline. LoRA, offloaded weights, bias, training,
unsupported layouts, and unsupported shapes retain ComfyUI's original route.

## Debugging and diagnostics

Kernel-only tracing:

```bash
OMNIXPU_DEBUG=1 python main.py
```

Dispatch decisions and fallback reasons:

```bash
OMNIXPU_DEBUG_VERBOSE=1 python main.py
```

LoRA weights are measured once when the LoRA node executes. Unique tensor sizes
are cached in a `ModelPatcher` attachment, inherited by clones, accumulated for
stacked LoRAs, and added to both `memory_required` and an explicitly supplied
`minimum_memory_required`. The base model's `model_size()` semantics stay
unchanged. Model loads read the cached attachment instead of rescanning patches.
DynamicVRAM layer scanning is disabled by default. To diagnose every LoRA
staging operation, including its XPU state and any failure, enable:

```bash
OMNIXPU_LORA_MEMORY_TRACE=1 python main.py
```

Set tracing variables before startup. The **OmniXPU Status** node reports:

- GPU and `omni_xpu_kernel` capabilities;
- each component's kind (`adapter` or `legacy_fix`) and apply status;
- attention and fused INT8 FFN routing counters.

Kitchen backend ownership can be inspected independently:

```bash
python -c 'import comfy_kitchen as ck; print(ck.list_backends()["xpu"])'
```

## Contribution boundary

New device-generic math, layouts, quantization, or fallback logic belongs in
`comfy_kitchen`. A custom-node adapter is appropriate only when a ComfyUI class
or call site cannot yet use the Kitchen API. Global correctness workarounds
must be opt-in and should carry a concrete upstream removal plan.

Model-pipeline or model-`forward` changes are outside this layer and require a
separate review.
